# AdventOfCode

## 2023
[First year](./2023/) participating in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). I'm doing this the 26/02/2024, during my semester abroad at [UQAC](https://github.com/FireGh0st/UQAC).

### Story:
Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.

You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all **fifty stars** by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants **one star**. Good luck!


### Day 1: Trebuchet?!

#### Part 1
Using a [python code](./2023/1/Part1.py), I solved the first part of the first day. The [problem](./2023/1/Subject.md) was to sum all the numbers that are formed by the first and last digit of each line of the input file.

#### Part 2
Still with a [Python code](./2023/1/Part2.py). The [problem](./2023/1/Subject.md) was to sum all the numbers that are formed by the first and last digit of each line of the input file, but this time, the digits could be spelled out with letters.

### Day 2: Cube Conundrum

#### Part 1
Using a [python code](./2023/2/Part1.py), I solved the first part of the second day. The [problem](./2023/2/Subject.md) was to determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes.

#### Part 2
Still with a [Python code](./2023/2/Part2.py). The [problem](./2023/2/Subject.md) was to find the minimum set of cubes that must have been present in each game and sum the power of these sets.
